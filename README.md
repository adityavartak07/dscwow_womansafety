Many women of our nation have faced some kind of harassments or any kind of physical abuse at any stage in their life. Such women of our nation are often told to stay silent in order not to face societal judgements.​

Staying silent is not a choice but the only option. Many girls go through mental breakdown due to this and anxiety issues when they are teenagers.​

So our idea is to bring upon an online portal which provide the private space of letting those stories out .​

Such stories will not only spread awareness, but also would give such girls company of those who are facing similar issues.​

Through this, online assistance can be provided to the user by keeping their id completely anonymous from the outside world.​
